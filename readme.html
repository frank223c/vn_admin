<h2 style="color:#0000bb"> How to Manage the page</h2>
<h3> Models</h3>
A model represents a table in the database. Then every table in the database is stored in <a href="adminapp\models.py">models.py</a> as a class overriding models.<br/>
You can add functions linked to each class, however it won't change the database if you don't call <i>.save()</i> fonction. <br/>
Make sure you also have <i>managed = True</i> in the classes you want to be modified from admin app.

<h3> Managing the models from admin page</h3>
You can add wanted models by adding <i>admin.site.register(ModelName,CustomAdmin)</i>. CustomAdmin is not needed, 
but you can override the default behaviour of Django with this parameter. To know further about this, check <a href="adminapp\admin.py">admin.py</a>.

<br/>Default behaviour : add a new entry, change existing entries or delete them.<br/>
As said before, make sure you have <i>managed = True</i> in the classes you want to be modified from admin app.

<h3> Modifying the linked database </h3>
If you want to link another database to the app, enter the credentials of the new databse in <a href="versatile_admin\settings.py">versatile_admin\settings.py</a> and follow the instructions <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/legacy-databases/">here</a>.<br/>
The models file may be overwritten though.
